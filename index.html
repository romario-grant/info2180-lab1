        <h2>Romario Grant</h2>
        <p>I am Romario Grant, a 22-year-old pursuing computer science to become a software engineer by next year, with a backup of going into photography if all things fail. I really like photography and listening to music. My top song currently is Fine Line by Harry Styles. I want to learn how to swim, and I should start swimming classes this weekend. I don't know what else to write about myself. I'm a boring guy. I am interested in Web Development because I use web apps daily and would like to understand the process behind creating them.</p>
